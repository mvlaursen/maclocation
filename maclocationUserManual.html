		<h2>maclocation User Manual</h2>
		<h3>maclocation</h3>
		<blockquote>
			
		
		maclocation is a simple Mac OS&nbsp;X&nbsp;command-line tool for for selecting a network location from among those currently configured in the Network preferences panel. It is useful if you use your Mac in more than one location (at work and at home, for example).

			<p>You must have administrative privileges to install maclocation.</p>
			<h4>Installing the maclocation tool</h4>
			In a Terminal shell:
			<ul>
				<li>Create a <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> directory if it does not exist: <tt>sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin</tt><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The permissions, owner, and group for <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> directory should look like this:<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>drwxr-xr-x root wheel</tt>
				<li>Copy maclocation to <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>: <tt>sudo cp maclocation /usr/local/bin</tt>
				<li>Set the SetUID bit on the installed maclocation tool: <tt>sudo chmod u+s /usr/local/bin/maclocation</tt><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The permissions, owner, and group for <tt>/usr/local/bin/maclocation</tt> should look like this:<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>-rwsr-xr-x root wheel</tt>
			</ul>
			<h4>Using the maclocation tool</h4>
			Run the maclocation tool from a Terminal shell, giving it the name of the network location you want to set. The tool recognizes any of the network location names listed in the Location pop-up menu in the Network preferences panel.
			<p>Example: <tt>/usr/local/bin/maclocation Home</tt></p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3>Location Agent</h3>
		<blockquote>
			
		Location Agent is a Mac application that runs the maclocation tool. A typical use, when the Mac user has separate login names for each location, is to place Location Agent in the Login Items list, so that it automatically sets the network location when the user logins in.

			<h4>Installing Location Agent</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Drop a copy of Location Agent in your Applications folder.
				<li>(Optional) Add Location Agent to the list of Login Items in the System Preferences panel.
			</ul>
			<h4>Using Location Agent</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Run Location&nbsp;Agent and open &quot;Location Agent&quot; &gt; &quot;Preferences&quot;. Choose a location from the &quot;Location&quot; pop-up menu. (Each time you choose a new location from the menu, Location&nbsp;Agent will make that location active.)
				<li>The next time Location Agent runs, it will activate the network location configured in the Location Agent Preferences. If you do configure a new location, Location Agent will automatically quit after waiting a minute.
			</ul>
